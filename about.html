      <h2>Who We Help</h2>
      <p>
        Life leaves you tired, stressed, and sore. Our clients are everyday people — professionals, parents, 
        athletes, and anyone who carries the weight of daily life on their shoulders. If you’ve ever walked 
        in feeling worn out, we want you to walk out feeling renewed.
      </p>

    <!-- How We Help -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>How We Help</h2>
      <p>
        Our skilled therapists use traditional <a href="about-chinese-massage.html" class="btn-link">Chinese Massage</a> techniques, deep tissue work, and Thai massage to 
        melt away tension and restore balance. Every session is designed around you — whether you need deep 
        relief from chronic pain or simply want to recharge after a long day.

      <h2>The Difference You’ll Feel</h2>
      <p>
        Most of our clients tell us the same thing: they walk in feeling weighed down and leave feeling 
        lighter, taller, and more alive. That’s not an accident — it’s the result of skilled hands, caring 
        hearts, and a commitment to helping you feel better.
