<h2>About Chinese Massage</h2>
<p>Chinese massage is more than relaxation — it's a form of traditional medicine practiced for over 2,000 years. Unlike Western massage, which focuses mainly on muscles, Chinese techniques work to restore the body’s energy balance and stimulate natural healing.</p>
<p>At New Grotto Massage, we use authentic methods like Tui Na, a hands-on technique that targets pressure points, relieves tension, and improves circulation. Many of our clients find that regular Chinese massage helps reduce chronic pain, boost energy, and calm the mind.</p>
<p>Come experience the deep healing and balance that only traditional Chinese massage can offer.</p>
